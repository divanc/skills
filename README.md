## Skills

### big-picture

Toggle mode for design discussions and explanations.

Agents approach design with complicated language and a lot of detail at
once. That's exhausting to process and error-prone: it's easy to miss a
detail in a 300-line reply, and the missed detail stays in context and
poisons everything downstream. Volume also flips the roles — the agent
drives, generating context, while the human is reduced to reviewing it.

This skill inverts both. The agent starts at the coarsest decision level —
why build this at all, what it covers — and descends one level per turn,
only after you agree. Each settled decision prunes most of the wrong designs
below it, so detail arrives only where it still matters. And the agent rides
passenger: you feed context, it acts on it or asks corrections — it doesn't
generate walls of it.

- One decision or one question per turn, ≤10 lines.
- Proposes itself on big layered questions; answers normally if you decline.
- `/big-picture <thing>` also works as an explainer: big picture first, then
  details of the part you pick.
- Stays on until "stop big-picture" / "normal mode".

### worktrees

Makes your repo look like this:

```
myrepo/
  main/          # the real clone (.git lives here)
  fix-auth/      # git worktree, branch fix-auth
  perf-web/      # git worktree, branch perf-web
```

One branch = one directory; the outer folder is just a container. The agent understands the layout and works within it: never switches branches inside a worktree, creates a new sibling per task instead, keeps dir names matching branch names.

- **Create** — worktree per branch; knows `.env` and deps need copying/installing.
- **Prune** — removes dead worktrees and merged branches; asks before touching unmerged work.
- **Migrate** — plain clone → this layout, three renames, no re-clone.

Why this beats a single checkout: no stash juggling or branch switching mid-work, every branch keeps its own build state, and parallel agent sessions get separate directories instead of clobbering one checkout.
